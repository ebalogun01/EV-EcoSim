Welcome to EV-Ecosim 1.0.0
=====================================
EV-Ecosim is a grid-aware python-based co-simulation platform for modeling and simulation of EV charging
stations integrated with Solar and Battery systems. This is a python based platform that interfaces with GridLAB-D,
a 3-phase unbalanced power flow solver, to estimate the impacts of EV (Fast) Charging Stations on power distribution
networks.

We have made a web-tool version available for public use. It runs most of the code shown in this documentation.

The project is accessible via Github and still under active development and improvements.

TODO - Link to tutorial.
TODO - Include information on the container.
