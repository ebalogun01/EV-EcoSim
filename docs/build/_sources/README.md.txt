## Requirements

GiSMo SLAC GridLAB-D installation (master branch): https://github.com/arras-energy/gridlabd. 
This GridLAB-D version is required for the python co-simulation functionality. Recommended use with AWS EC2 SLAC 
GiSMo HiPAS GridLAB-D AMI (beauharnois-X).

## Folder descriptions

### ambient_data

Hosts ambient temperature data for capturing the effects of environmental conditions on subsystems, such as battery, 
transformers, charging stations.


### base_load_data

Includes existing base case building/home load (usually uncontrollable) within the distribution grid. This work uses 
proprietary Pecan Street Data. Below is an exmaple data prototype for the base load data. Note that column fields are
case-sensitive. The data used in the original paper has a minute resolution, as is the power system simulation. ``

### batt_sys_identification
Battery system identification module. Hosts the class for generating battery system identification parameters
from experimental data. This module leverages a genetic algorithm to optimize the battery model parameters. 
The battery model is a 2nd order RC Equivalent circuit model (ECM). One can this module to generate custom NMC
battery parameters by uploading experimental data to the `batt_sys_identification/data` folder and running the module.
The module will generate a `.csv` file with the battery parameters in the `batt_sys_identification/params` folder.
The data prototype is shown below. Note that column fields are case-sensitive.

![batt_sys_data_proto.png](doc_images%2Fbatt_sys_data_proto.png)

The module will save a new `.csv` file with an additional field for the corrected open circuit voltage (OCV) values;
this field (column) will be labelled `ocv_corr` within the new battery data csv, including the existing columns as shown
in the data prototype above.

Once the battery parameters are generated, they can be used in the `battery_data` folder and `configs/battery.json` can 
be modified so the model runs using the new custom parameters.

### charging_sim

This contains the `configs` folder which includes the configuration files for all the relevant modules.Hosts the implementation of the physical modules, including:
##### `battery.py` - Battery cell module. 
##### `batterypack.py` - Battery pack module.
##### `batteryAgingSim.py` - Battery aging module.
##### `controller.py` - Controller module.
##### `chargingStation.py` - Charging station module.
##### `electricityPrices.py` - Electricity prices module. 
##### `optimization.py` - Optimization module.
##### `orchestrator.py` - Simulation orchestrator module.
##### `solar.py` - Solar PV module.
##### `utils.py` - Hosts utility functions used by some modules.
##### `simulate.py` - Offline DER control optimization for cost minimization (this is run for offline mode (no state feedback)).


### DLMODELS

This includes legacy load forecasts models developed (not needed).


### elec_rates

Includes .csv files for electricity Time-of-use (TOU) rates. The input data prototype for electricity rates
is shown below. User must upload a normal full-year sized data (for 365 days) to avoid
any errors.

<img src="doc_images/elecrates_data_proto.png" width="100">

The data required must be in the format shown above. The `electricityPrices.py` module will read the data and sample
prices during optimization and simulation. The data should be one full year of TOU rate prices at 15 minute resolution.
The `electricityPrices.py` module can also help with downscaling the data to 15 minute resolution if the data is at a
much coarser resolution. The module will save the downscaled data in the `elec_rates` folder.

### feeders
Library of IEEE test feeders and PNNL taxonomy feeders for distribution systems in the GridLAB-D `.glm` format.
IEEE feeders have spot loads specified at primary distribution level. PNNL taxonomy feeders have spot loads specified at
primary or secondary distribution level.


### feeder_population
Scripts for populating base feeder models with time-varying loads and resources using the load data in base_load_data. 
`feeder_population.py` generates the necessary files for a co-simulation run based on the parameters specified in 
`feeder_population/config.txt`. This module uses the 
Requires residential load data not included in repo (limited access).



### solar_data
Includes solar irradiance data for capturing the effects of environmental conditions on overall system cost. Default
data for solar irradiance is from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) for the San Francisco Bay Area.
The data prototype is from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and is shown below. Note that column fields
are case-sensitive.

![solar_data_proto.png](doc_images%2Fsolar_data_proto.png)

Month labels are indexed from 1 to 12, inclusive; 1 - January, 12 - December. The original data is in hourly resolution.
The *EV-Ecosim* data prototype is in 15 minute intervals by default, with irradiance oversampled 4 times from hourly 
dataset. The GHI represents the "Global Horizontal Irradiance" in W/m^2, which is the total amount of shortwave radiation
received from above by a surface horizontal to the ground. 

### test_cases

#### Co-simulation cases.
 `base_case`- Reads voltage from GridLAB-D and writes power injections at each timestep (no EV charging or DER).

`rlsf` - base_case plus implements a recursive least squares filter to estimate network model online (not used)

`battery` - base_case plus transformer thermal model plus DER integration (included battery and solar).

`transformer` - base_case plus simulation of transformer thermal model for each transformer in GridLAB-D model (not used).



### analysis

Scripts for plotting and analysis of co-simulation results. Includes post optimization and simulation cost 
calculation modules and voltage impacts on the distribution grid.

`plot_results.py` - This module is used post-simulation to parse the voltages from the power-simulation to calculate the percentage
voltage violations per ANSI C84.1. The file also generates voltage distribution plots. A user can modify the
SIMULATION_FOLDER variable which is the string of the path where the powerflow simulation output voltages at each node
exist.

`load_post_opt_costs.py` - This module is calculates the levelized cost of energy and populates into tables/cost matrices, which are saved in the
respective files and folders. The module also generates plots for the cost analysis.  

`cost_analysis.py` - This module contains the `CostEstimator` class, which estimates the cost of the different grid and DER components
from the simulation.


## How to run
Create a new environment using `conda env create --name <your env name> -f environment.yml`OR 
install packages listed in the environment manually (RECOMMENDED)
Ensure gridlabd is installed by following recommended installation method.

For battery test case:
* Navigate to `test_cases/battery/feeder_population` and run `feeder_population.py`. This uses the 
  `test_cases/battery/feeder_population/config.txt` settings to prepare the power system and populate the secondary
  distribution network with time-varying base loads, EV charging stations, with the required transformers.
* Once confirmed that `feeder_population.py` has run successfully and generates the required `IEEE123_secondary.glm` and
  `IEEE123_populated.glm` files, you are done with the initial pre-simulation run prep.
* Now navigate one level of out `/feeder_population` and run scenarios.py using `python3 scenarios.py`

For base case:
* Navigate to `EV50_cosimulation/feeder_population` and run `feeder_population.py`. This uses the 
  `./feeder_population/config.txt` settings to prepare the power system and populate the secondary distribution network \
  with time-varying base loads
* Navigate to `test_cases/base_case` and run master_sim.py using `python3 master_sim.py`

## Post-simulation analysis
 * This is done with the modules in the `analysis` folder. Please see the `analysis` folder section  for more details.
